            <h3>OF</h3>
            <p>The of function creates an observable that emits the values you pass into it as separate emissions and
                completes after emitting all of them. It's like saying, â€œGive me an observable that just emits these
                values.</p>
            <h3>When to Use of</h3>
            <p>Use of when you have individual values or objects and want to turn them into a single observable. This is
                useful for static values, simple sequences, or testing.</p>

            <h3>From</h3>
            <p>The from function takes an array, iterable, promise, or any observable-like object and converts it into
                an
                observable that emits each item in the sequence or the resolved value in the case of promises.</p>
            <h3>When to Use from</h3>
            <p>Use from when you want to turn a collection (array) or a promise into an observable. This is common
                when you have data from APIs (promises) or multiple items in a collection.
