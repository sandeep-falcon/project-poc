    <h3>exhaust Map</h3>
    <p>The exhaustMap operator works by mapping each source value to an observable, and then subscribing to that
        observable.
        It ensures that only one inner observable is active at a time. If a new source value arrives while an inner
        observable is still active, the new value is ignored until the inner observable completes.</p>

        <h3>When to Use</h3>
        <p>You want to prevent concurrent tasks triggered by frequent events, such as button clicks or form submissions.
            Only the first task is important until it completes; any intermediate events should be ignored.
            You want to avoid accidentally triggering multiple actions, like multiple API calls on repeated clicks.
        </p>
